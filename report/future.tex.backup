\section{Future scope}
A lot of improvements can be made to this project, some of which we'll mention here:
\begin{itemize}
 \item Implement search operation in the text area on the UI.
 \item Implement search operation in the pattern list on the UI.
 \item The rendered tree could be more symmetric, perhaps with inclusion of null nodes.
 \item For the abstract tree it is difficult to check, if it has only one child, whether it is left or right.
 \item The text editor could be extended to include syntax highlighting(will involve changes to parser).
\end{itemize}
