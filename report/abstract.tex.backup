The mechanism of GCC machine descriptions has been quite successful as demonstrated by a wide variety of targets for which GCC ports exist. However, this mechanism is quite ad hoc and the machine descriptions are difficult to read, construct, maintain, and enhance because of the verbosity, repetitiveness, and the amount of details. We propose a language called specRTL which provides a compositional specification mechanism for defining patterns that describe RTL templates in machine descriptions. These patterns can be refined by extending them and by associating concrete details with them in a need based manner. Machine descriptions written using specRTL are smaller and simpler and hence easy to read, construct, and maintain. specRTL integrates with conventional machine descriptions seamlessly.
