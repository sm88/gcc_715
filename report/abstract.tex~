\par{In GCC, the machine descriptions are difficult to read, construct, maintain, and enhance because of the verbosity, repetitiveness, and the amount of details. specRTL\cite{6} provides a compositional specification mechanism for defining patterns that describe RTL templates in machine descriptions. These patterns can be refined by extending them and by associating concrete details with them in a need based manner. Machine descriptions written using specRTL are smaller and simpler and hence easy to read, construct, and maintain. specRTL integrates with conventional machine descriptions seamlessly.} \\
\noindent{The purpose of the project is to supplement the specRTL description language by providing a pictorial visualization of the patterns which it is capable of describing. The user can browze for an existing specRTL file or create a new one and the tool would produce a n-ary tree annotated with the appropriate attibutes on specific nodes, representing the constructs.}
